  <dc:description>The Army Barracks building where soldiers can be seen taking on some leisure activities such as playing cards. Beginning on April 11, 1918, the University instituted a training program for automobile and gas engine mechanics. Seven barracks that could house 1,000, a mess hall that could seat 2,000, an administrative building and the Y.M.C.A. Hospitality House were built on the hill above O'Hara Street. Within six months, 2,200 men were being trained.</dc:description>
