He had became revered in the United States because of the help and leadership he provided from France during the American Revolution. Lafayette&apos;s visit across the United States was hosted by President James Monroe. In 1814, William Barclay Foster (Father of Composer Stephen Foster) Sold 30 Acres of Land , between today&apos;s 39th and 40th Streets, for $12,000 to the U.S. Government to Erect the Arsenal. The Arsenal was Designed by B. H. Latrobe.  The Arsenal Served As a Supply and Manufacturing Center for the Troops in the West. On September 17, 1862, an Explosion Struck the Allegheny Arsenal.

The Cathedral was designed by architect Charles Zeller Klauder and is the tallest gothic -style building and second-tallest education building in the world. The structure is a mix of English and French Gothic styles, which houses a massive commons room and nationality rooms. The final cost was between $8 million and $12 million. It took about 10 years to build, thanks to the Depression that interrupted construction and left the half-finished building with exposed beams for a few years in the early 1930s.

The focus of the room is a nine-foot fireplace with &quot;fixings&quot; of a log hook, heavy iron kettles, a spider, gridiron, long handled waffle iron, bread shovel, skewers, ladles and forks. A small recess in the brick wall would have served to bake bread.  Pine beams used in the seven-foot-high ceiling and fireplace were brought from Massachusetts. White pine is used for the seminar table, benches and chairs. Special light fixtures are made of pierced tin.   The small closet between the blackboard and fireplace contains a secret panel. Once the concealed latch is discovered, its release causes the wall to swing open, revealing a hidden staircase to the upper loft, which is furnished as a 19th- century bedroom.

The English Room, classroom 144, was designed by Albert A. Klimcheck in a 16th century Tudor Gothic style, and reflects major aspects of American History: English language and law.  It is the largest of the Nationality Rooms and contains a large amount original material from London&apos;s House of Commons which was destroyed by bombs during World War II.  Each window bears a coat of arms representing an English city, or a famous English person from history.  The English room was dedicated November 21, 1952.  This room, along with twenty five other Nationality Rooms all with different architectural styles, was conceived in the 1920s by sociologist Ruth Crawford Mitchell as a means of linking the university with the immigrant culture of the steel working families.

He had became revered in the United States because of the help and leadership he provided from France during the American Revolution. Lafayette&apos;s visit across the United States was hosted by President James Monroe. In 1814, William Barclay Foster (Father of Composer Stephen Foster) Sold 30 Acres of Land , between today&apos;s 39th and 40th Streets, for $12,000 to the U.S. Government to Erect the Arsenal. The Arsenal was Designed by B. H. Latrobe.  The Arsenal Served As a Supply and Manufacturing Center for the Troops in the West. On September 17, 1862, an Explosion Struck the Allegheny Arsenal. It Killed 78 People, who Were For the Most Part Young Girls.  This Explosion Became the Worst Civilian Disaster of The Civil War.        Lawrenceville (Pittsburgh, Pa.).

The design of the Chinese Room was influenced by an 18th century reception hall in Peiping’s Forbidden City.  The mural on the wall is a picture of the great Chinese thinker, Confucius. The table is designed to reflect his belief of equality between teachers and students around a circular table.  The Chinese Room was dedicated October 6, 1939.  This room, along with twenty-five other Nationality Rooms all with different architectural styles, was conceived in the 1920s by sociologist Ruth Crawford Mitchell as a means of linking the University of Pittsburgh with the immigrant culture of the steel working families.

The Cathedral was designed by architect Charles Zeller Klauder and is the tallest gothic -style building and second-tallest education building in the world. The structure is a mix of English and French Gothic styles, which houses a massive commons room and nationality rooms. The final cost was between $8 million and $12 million. It took about 10 years to build, thanks to the Depression that interrupted construction and left the half-finished building with exposed beams for a few years in the early 1930s.

The focus of the room is a nine-foot fireplace with &quot;fixings&quot; of a log hook, heavy iron kettles, a spider, gridiron, long handled waffle iron, bread shovel, skewers, ladles and forks. A small recess in the brick wall would have served to bake bread.  Pine beams used in the seven-foot-high ceiling and fireplace were brought from Massachusetts. White pine is used for the seminar table, benches and chairs. Special light fixtures are made of pierced tin.   The small closet between the blackboard and fireplace contains a secret panel. Once the concealed latch is discovered, its release causes the wall to swing open, revealing a hidden staircase to the upper loft, which is furnished as a 19th- century bedroom.

The English Room, classroom 144, was designed by Albert A. Klimcheck in a 16th century Tudor Gothic style, and reflects major aspects of American History: English language and law.  It is the largest of the Nationality Rooms and contains a large amount original material from London&apos;s House of Commons which was destroyed by bombs during World War II.  Each window bears a coat of arms representing an English city, or a famous English person from history.  The English room was dedicated November 21, 1952.  This room, along with twenty five other Nationality Rooms all with different architectural styles, was conceived in the 1920s by sociologist Ruth Crawford Mitchell as a means of linking the university with the immigrant culture of the steel working families.
